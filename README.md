# Week-9

I deployed the mhn-honeypot-1

I encountered a number of issues. First of all, when trying to deploy my honeypot on the mhn admin console the first time, for some reason, it informed me that my username and passqord were incorrect, even though I am certain that they were the ones that I chose. I then attempted to essentially start the entire process over, but installing the mhn admin application was running so slowly that even after an hour it still was not finished. I don't know if this occurred because my computer runs very slowly or if it was because of another issue. Another issue that I encountered was when trying to access the mhn admin console, my http access was not enabled which made it impossible to reach that page in my browser.
