# Week-9

I deployed the mhn-honeypot-1

I encountered a number of issues. First of all, when trying to deploy my honeypot on the mhn admin console the first time, for some reason, it informed me that my username and passqord were incorrect, even though I am certain that they were the ones that I chose. Another issue that I encountered was when trying to access the mhn admin console, my http access was not enabled which made it impossible to reach that page in my browser.
